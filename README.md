# 🌟 My 5-Day Generative AI Intensive Journey with Google 🌟

🚀 **Overview**  
I’m embarking on an exciting 5-day adventure with Google’s Generative AI Intensive Course! This program dives deep into the world of AI, spanning foundational large language models (LLMs), embeddings, AI agents, domain-specific models, and MLOps. I’ll be tackling daily tasks, capturing key takeaways, and curating a collection of resources to share. Follow along as I explore this cutting-edge field!
